Deep Q-Learning Snake Game
Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning to play the classic Snake game. The agent utilizes a neural network model to predict the best actions at each step based on the current game state, learning from its experiences through the process of trial and error.

Project Structure
Agent.py: Contains the core logic of the Q-learning agent. The agent interacts with the environment (Snake game) and learns from its experiences.

game.py: Implements the Snake game environment, including the game mechanics such as movement, collision detection, and food placement.

model.py: Defines the Linear_QNet neural network model and QTrainer class. The model is used to predict the Q-values (expected rewards) for each action, and the trainer optimizes the model using the Q-learning algorithm.

helper.py: Includes helper functions for plotting the agent’s learning progress over time.

train.py: Main script for training the agent. Runs the game environment, interacts with the agent, and trains the model.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

torch: For building and training the neural network.

numpy: For handling numerical computations.

matplotlib: For plotting the agent's performance over time.

pygame: For implementing the Snake game environment.

we can install the dependencies using pip:


pip install torch numpy matplotlib pygame

How It Works
Agent Class (Agent.py): The agent interacts with the Snake game by observing the current state (position of the snake, food, and obstacles) and selecting an action (move up, down, left, or right). The agent learns over time by storing experiences and improving its model using the Q-learning algorithm.

Game Environment (game.py): The Snake game logic is implemented here. The game’s state, rewards, and collision detection are managed. The agent interacts with the game using this class by calling functions to get the state and perform actions.

Neural Network (model.py): The Linear_QNet class defines the structure of the neural network that predicts Q-values. The QTrainer class optimizes the model by calculating the loss between predicted Q-values and the target Q-values (based on the agent's experience).

Training (train.py): The training loop where the agent plays the game repeatedly. The agent learns by interacting with the game, storing experiences, and updating the model over time. Performance is tracked using plots generated by the helper functions in helper.py.

How to Run
Training the Agent:

To train the agent, simply run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This will train the agent to play the Snake game and improve its performance over time.

Visualizing Progress:

During the training, the agent’s performance (score over time) will be plotted using the matplotlib library. This allows you to visualize how the agent is learning and improving its gameplay.

Key Components
Q-learning Algorithm: The agent uses Q-learning to maximize the cumulative reward. It learns an optimal policy by updating Q-values using the Bellman equation.

Deep Q-Network (DQN): The agent employs a neural network to approximate the Q-function, predicting the Q-values for each action based on the current state.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: The agent balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action) using the epsilon-greedy strategy, where epsilon decreases over time.

Future Improvements
Model Architecture: Experiment with deeper or more complex neural network architectures to improve the agent's performance.

Reward Shaping: Refine the reward structure to encourage better behavior, such as steering away from walls or avoiding unnecessary collisions.

Advanced Q-Learning Techniques: Implement enhancements such as Double Q-Learning, Dueling DQN, or Prioritized Experience Replay for improved learning efficiency.

Example Output
As the agent trains, it should gradually increase its score, eventually learning to navigate the Snake game efficiently. The training progress is shown through plots, where the average score over time can be visualized.
